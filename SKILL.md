# Market Intelligence Collector v2.0

Collect comprehensive market information for games and tools targeting international English-speaking markets.

**Version**: 2.0.0
**Updated**: 2025-12-17
**Data Sources**: 74 platforms (32 core + 15 Reddit + 12 intelligence + 15 supplementary)

## When to Use

- User mentions "collect", "research", "investigate", "gather" + product name
- User asks about market information, user reviews, or competitive intelligence
- User needs SEO content material or competitive analysis data
- User provides a product name and wants to understand market reception

## Input Requirements

1. **Keyword** (required): Product name, e.g., "Minecraft", "Notion"
2. **Type** (required): `game` or `tool`
3. **Background Info** (optional): Official URL, category, target users, etc.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Confirm Input

If type is not provided, ask:
```
Is this a game or a tool? This determines which data sources I'll use.
```

If keyword is ambiguous (common name), ask for clarification:
```
There are multiple products named "{keyword}". Can you provide more context or the official website?
```

### Phase 1: Core Information Collection (Required)

**1.1 Search for Official Sources**

Run these WebSearch queries in parallel:

For **games**:
```
WebSearch: "{keyword} official site"
WebSearch: "{keyword} steam"
WebSearch: "{keyword} metacritic"
WebSearch: "site:reddit.com {keyword} review"
WebSearch: "{keyword} ign review"
```

For **tools**:
```
WebSearch: "{keyword} official site"
WebSearch: "{keyword} g2 reviews"
WebSearch: "{keyword} product hunt"
WebSearch: "site:reddit.com {keyword}"
WebSearch: "{keyword} vs alternatives"
```

**1.2 Fetch Key Pages**

Use WebFetch to extract detailed information from discovered URLs.

For each URL, use appropriate extraction prompts:

**Official Website:**
```
WebFetch prompt: "Extract: product name, tagline, main description,
key features (list), pricing information, supported platforms,
target audience, company/developer name"
```

**Steam (games):**
```
WebFetch prompt: "Extract: game title, description, release date,
developer, publisher, price, overall review sentiment and percentage,
total reviews count, recent review sentiment, tags/genres, platforms"
```

**G2/Capterra (tools):**
```
WebFetch prompt: "Extract: product name, overall rating, total reviews,
pros mentioned by users (top 5), cons mentioned by users (top 5),
best for (user types), pricing tier"
```

**Metacritic (games):**
```
WebFetch prompt: "Extract: metascore, user score, critic reviews count,
user reviews count, summary of critical reception"
```

**Product Hunt (tools):**
```
WebFetch prompt: "Extract: product tagline, description, upvotes count,
reviews count, maker information, launch date, featured comments"
```

### Phase 2: User Sentiment Collection

**2.1 Reddit Discussions**

From Reddit search results, fetch 2-3 most relevant discussion threads:
```
WebFetch prompt: "Extract: main topic, top comments (summarize sentiment),
common praise points, common complaints, use cases mentioned"
```

**2.2 Review Aggregation**

Compile ratings from multiple sources into a comparison table.

### Phase 3: Media Coverage (Games) / Professional Reviews (Tools)

**For games:**
```
WebSearch: "{keyword} review ign"
WebSearch: "{keyword} review gamespot"
WebSearch: "{keyword} review polygon"
```

**For tools:**
```
WebSearch: "{keyword} review techcrunch"
WebSearch: "{keyword} review {category} best"
```

Extract: publication name, rating/score, key quote, reviewer's verdict.

### Phase 4: Visual Resources

```
WebSearch: "{keyword} official trailer youtube" (games)
WebSearch: "{keyword} demo video youtube" (tools)
WebSearch: "{keyword} screenshots official"
```

Extract: YouTube video URLs, official image URLs when available.

### Phase 5: Generate Structured Report

Use the appropriate template:
- Games: `templates/game-report.md`
- Tools: `templates/tool-report.md`
- **Flash Mode**: `templates/flash-report.md` (5-minute quick assessment)

Fill in all sections. For missing data, use format:
```
[NOT FOUND: {reason}]
```

## Report Modes

### Flash Report (快报模式) - 5 Minutes

**When to use:**
- Hot trending topic needs quick assessment
- Initial screening before full investment
- User requests "quick look" or "fast check"

**What to collect (minimum):**
1. Google Trends current status
2. Primary platform rating (Steam/G2/etc.)
3. Quick SERP scan for competition

**Output:** `flash-report.md` with Flash Battle Index

**Command trigger:**
```
User: Quick check on {keyword}
User: Flash report for {keyword}
User: Is {keyword} worth investigating?
```

### Full Report (完整报告) - 20-30 Minutes

**When to use:**
- Confirmed opportunity needs deep analysis
- Content creation planning
- Competitive intelligence

**What to collect:** All 13 sections in full template

**Output:** `game-report.md` or `tool-report.md`

## Fallback Strategies

### WebFetch Failures

If WebFetch fails for a URL:

1. **First attempt**: Retry once after 3 seconds
2. **Second attempt**: Use Playwright MCP
   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url)
   mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot()
   ```
3. **Third attempt**: Mark as `[FETCH_FAILED: {URL}]` and continue

### Data Not Found

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Game not on Steam | Search Epic Games Store, GOG |
| Tool not on G2 | Search Capterra, TrustRadius |
| No Reddit discussions | Note "Limited community discussion found" |
| No media reviews | May indicate niche product, note this |

### Disambiguation

If search results show multiple products with same name:
- Add type qualifier: `"{keyword}" game` or `"{keyword}" software`
- Add developer/company name if known
- Ask user for clarification if still ambiguous

## Output Format

### Structure Requirements

1. **All data must have source URLs** - Every piece of information needs a clickable source
2. **Use tables for structured data** - Ratings, features, comparisons
3. **Use blockquotes for direct quotes** - Official descriptions, user reviews
4. **Mark missing data explicitly** - `[NOT FOUND]` with reason
5. **Include collection timestamp** - Data may become outdated

### Language

- Collect data in English (original)
- Keep quotes and descriptions in English
- Output report in English for AI processing

## Key Principles

1. **Accuracy over completeness** - Don't fabricate data; mark gaps clearly
2. **Source everything** - Every claim needs a URL
3. **Respect rate limits** - Don't spam requests to same domain
4. **Handle failures gracefully** - One failed source shouldn't stop the whole process
5. **Prioritize official sources** - Official > user reviews > media > forums
6. **MANDATORY: Every report must end with a verdict** - No report is complete without Battle Assessment and Executive Recommendations

## Mandatory Output Requirements

**CRITICAL: Every report MUST include these final sections:**

### Section 12: Battle Assessment (五事七计)
- Five Factors Analysis table (道天地将法)
- Battle Index score (1-10) with GO/CAUTION/NO-GO indicator
- Verdict sentence explaining the score

### Section 13: Executive Recommendations (决策建议)
- Market Opportunity Assessment
- Recommended Actions (Immediate + Short-term + Hold conditions)
- Risk Alerts table
- ROI Estimate
- **Final Verdict box** with clear PROCEED / CAUTION / SKIP recommendation

**A report without these sections is INCOMPLETE and must not be delivered.**

### Battle Index Scoring Guide

| Score | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 8-10 | 🟢 GO | High confidence opportunity, proceed immediately |
| 5-7 | 🟡 CAUTION | Mixed signals, proceed with specific conditions |
| 1-4 | 🔴 NO-GO | Poor opportunity, skip or wait for changes |

### Six Factors Assessment (六事评估) - v2.0

| Factor | Weight | What to Assess |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| 道 (User Pain) | 20% | Are users actively complaining about alternatives? |
| 天 (Timing) | 20% | Is Google Trends rising or falling? |
| 地 (Competition) | 20% | How many strong competitors in SERP? |
| 将 (Team) | 15% | Is the product well-funded and actively developed? |
| 法 (Product) | 15% | Is the product stable with good reviews? |
| **己 (Self)** | 10% | Do we have capability to execute in this space? |

**New in v2.0**: Added 己 (Self-Assessment) factor to evaluate our own capability before committing resources.

### Risk Modifiers (风险调节系数)

Apply these modifiers to the raw Battle Index:

| Risk Type | Level | Modifier |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Legal Risk (法律风险) | None / Low / Medium / High / Critical | 1.0 / 0.95 / 0.85 / 0.70 / 0.50 |
| Creator Risk (创作者风险) | Established / Known / Anonymous / Young / Controversial | 1.0 / 0.95 / 0.85 / 0.75 / 0.60 |
| Platform Risk (平台风险) | Owned / Stable / Volatile / May Shutdown | 1.0 / 0.95 / 0.80 / 0.60 |

**Final Battle Index** = Raw Score × Legal Modifier × Creator Modifier × Platform Modifier

### Dynamic Weighting by Lifecycle

Adjust factor weights based on keyword lifecycle stage:

| Stage | 道 | 天 | 地 | 将 | 法 | 己 |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Emerging (Trends < 20) | 15% | 30% | 20% | 10% | 15% | 10% |
| Growing (Trends 20-60) | 20% | 20% | 20% | 15% | 15% | 10% |
| Peak (Trends > 60) | 20% | 10% | 25% | 15% | 20% | 10% |
| Declining (Trends -30%) | 25% | 5% | 20% | 15% | 25% | 10% |

## Advanced Data Collection

### Using Existing Scripts (关键词挖掘项目)

Located at: `/Users/suifeng/python/2026/seo-tools/关键词挖掘/`

**Scripts that DON'T need API keys** (can be used directly):

| Script | Path | Data Type | How to Use |
|--------|------|-----------|------------|
| Google Trends | `src/collectors/general/google_trends.py` | Interest over time, related queries | Uses `pytrends` library |
| Google Suggest | `src/collectors/general/google_suggest.py` | Autocomplete suggestions | Web scraping |
| Steam | `src/collectors/gaming/steam.py` | Concurrent players, reviews | Web scraping |
| itch.io | `src/collectors/gaming/itch_io.py` | Games, ratings, downloads | Web scraping |

**Scripts that NEED API keys** (check `.env` first):

| Script | Path | API Required | Env Variable |
|--------|------|--------------|--------------|
| YouTube | `src/collectors/general/youtube.py` | YouTube Data API v3 | `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` |
| Reddit | `src/collectors/general/reddit.py` | Reddit API | `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` |
| Twitch | `src/collectors/gaming/twitch.py` | Twitch API | `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` |

**Usage Pattern:**
```bash
# Check if API keys are configured
cat /Users/suifeng/python/2026/seo-tools/关键词挖掘/.env

# Run a specific collector (example)
cd /Users/suifeng/python/2026/seo-tools/关键词挖掘
python -m src.collectors.gaming.steam --keyword "{keyword}"
```

### Using Playwright for Direct Platform Access

When WebFetch fails or you need real-time data, use Playwright MCP:

**Google Trends (Essential for timeline data):**
```
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q={keyword}&hl=en" })
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({ time: 3 })
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot()
```

Extract from snapshot: interest over time values, geographic breakdown, related queries.

**itch.io (For indie/web games):**
```
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: "https://itch.io/search?q={keyword}" })
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({ time: 2 })
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot()
```

Extract: game titles, ratings, number of ratings, authors.

**Steam Store (When WebFetch fails):**
```
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: "https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term={keyword}" })
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({ time: 2 })
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot()
```

**Always close browser after collection:**
```
mcp__playwright__browser_close()
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

| Product Type | Key Platforms | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Steam Games | Steam, Metacritic, Reddit, YouTube | Use `steam.py` script for player counts |
| Web/Browser Games | itch.io, CrazyGames, Newgrounds | Playwright preferred for these |
| Mobile Games | App Store, Google Play, TapTap | WebFetch usually works |
| SaaS Tools | G2, Capterra, Product Hunt | API access limited, use WebFetch |
| Open Source | GitHub, npm, PyPI | GitHub API available in scripts |

### Viral/Trend Analysis (Games)

For understanding HOW a game went viral:

1. **Google Trends** - When did interest spike?
2. **Know Your Meme** - Search `site:knowyourmeme.com "{keyword}"`
3. **Fandom Wiki** - Version history, timeline
4. **TikTok** - Manual search (no API), note top hashtag views
5. **YouTube** - Sort by upload date + view count to find first viral videos

## Integration with Keyword Mining System
